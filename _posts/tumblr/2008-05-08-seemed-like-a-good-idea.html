This is the railroad bridge I walked across with my friend when I was in college. We joked about that scene in <u>Stand By Me</u> where Gordy is almost run down by a train on a bridge.  Halfway across, we heard a train horn.  We looked back and way down the track we saw a train, with a plume of smoke rising up.
<br/><br/>
We ran. Fast.
<br/><br/>
Once we got to the other side, we looked back again and saw that the train hadn&rsquo;t moved at all.  It was sitting at a loading station. You&rsquo;d think we would have noticed that the first time.
