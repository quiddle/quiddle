title: This is the first serious long-term plan I’ve ever had. I figure, Shit, I’m
  a guy with long term plans now? I need to re-roll my character sheet. I start with
  appearance (self-aware poser), and ramp up the mathematical angle, to cobble together
  a philosophy of punk rock mathematics. It is this:1) People use the average Joe’s
  poor mathematics as a way to control, exploit, and numerically fuck him over.2)
  Mathematics is the subject in which, regardless of what the authorities tell you
  is true, you can verify every last iota of truth, with a minimum of equipment.Therefore,
  if you are concerned with the empowerment of everyday people, and you believe that
  it’s probably a good idea to be skeptical of authority you could do worse than to
  develop your skills at being able to talk math in such a way that anyone can ask
  questions, can express curiosity, can imagine applying it in the most weird-ass
  off-the-wall ways possible.
