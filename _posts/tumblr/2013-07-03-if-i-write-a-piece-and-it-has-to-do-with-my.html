title: If I write a piece and it has to do with my walking from the living room to
  the kitchen and some funny things happen, the same funny things will happen every
  time. Those are my chords. On the way, I may do some different things, but I’m not
  forgetting where the chords are and I always hit them. I may change things, but
  the song is the same. The improvisation is always within that, and the timing is
  always different. You can’t sit there and watch Bill Cosby — I don’t care how many
  times you’ve seen the piece, unless it’s “Noah” or “The Dentist” — and beat me to
  the punch line. Because I’m not going there yet. It may take me two minutes, three
  minutes or 15 minutes in that piece to get to the kitchen. But the song is the same.

<p>People usually call it pretentious to compare a non-musical process to music. Especially so with jazz. (<em>“It’s the notes you don’t play”</em> is an overused, hacky punchline.) But man, I compare my process to music all the time. Editing, especially, has to be musical in order to be great. So it gives me chills to hear the Cos say something like this.</p>
