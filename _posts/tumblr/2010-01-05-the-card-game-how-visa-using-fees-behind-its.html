This is great for banks- they get more money per transaction, but it all gets passed along to the consumer in the end.</p>

<p>Personally, I stopped using my debit card a few years ago (except at CostCo). Everything goes on the credit card (e.g. bills, daycare, groceries) and is paid off every month. There&rsquo;s much better liability protection on a credit card, lower fees for the merchants (as opposed to debit transactions), plus I get amazon giftcards every month or so.</p>
