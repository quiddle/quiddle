<blockquote>Lucky for us, <strong>there are some struggles that we can get rid of</strong> or, at the very least, conceive of a world without through lessening the loads of our brothers and sisters who have different experiences from our own. There are things that come easy to me that donâ€™t come easy to you and I want to help.</blockquote>
