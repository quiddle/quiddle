title: I'm attempting to follow your instructions for migrating RDS into VPC.  How
  did you get around the need to GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%' ?  I
  get an access denied error.

<p>I was just able to create a user and add the replication privilege, doing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mysqluser@FOO.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com</p>
<p>[mysql]&gt; create user &lsquo;testrepl&rsquo;@&rsquo;%&rsquo; identified by 'SAFEPASSWORD&rsquo;;</p>
<p>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)Â <span>mysqluser@FOO.cqdc1rbnps8s.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com</span></p>
<p>[mysql]&gt; grant replication slave on *.* to 'testrepl&rsquo;@&rsquo;%&rsquo;;</p>
<p>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that accomplishing this migration required that I was running MySQL 5.6. It might be that you&rsquo;re running an older version which prevents this type of setup.</p>
