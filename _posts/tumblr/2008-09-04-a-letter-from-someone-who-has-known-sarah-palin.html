<a href="http://my2bucks.wordpress.com/2008/09/02/a-letter-from-someone-who-has-known-sarah-palin-since-1992/">A letter from someone who has known Sarah Palin since 1992</a><br/><p>I don&rsquo;t identify as a staunch Democrat by any means, but more and more frequently I find that I truly dislike the Republican offerings, which, due to a two party system, leaves me with only one other choice. Lucky for me this time around (unlike 2004) I&rsquo;m looking forward to casting my vote.</p>
