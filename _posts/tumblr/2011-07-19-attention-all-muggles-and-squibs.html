<a href="http://blog.wordnik.com/attention-all-muggles-and-squibs">Attention all muggles and squibs!</a><br/><p>Etymology of many of the names, words and spells from Harry Potter. Lots of good stuff!</p>
<blockquote>Characters’ names are often also common words.  A dumbledore is a bumblebee.  Snape is a ship-building term that means “to bevel the end of (a timber or plank) so that it will fit accurately upon an inclined surface.” Hagrid is the past participle of hagride, which means “to harass or torment by dread or nightmares.”  Skeeter is a term for an annoying pest, and not just Rita Skeeter, blood-sucking journalist.  Mundungus is “waste animal product” or “poor-quality tobacco with a foul, rancid, or putrid smell,” a good name for a sneaky thief.</blockquote>
