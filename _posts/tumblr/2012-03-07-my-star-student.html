<p>Every week at Westley&rsquo;s day care they have a Star Student. The student brings things from home (a picture, a book, a toy, a snack, a favorite album) and the class learns about what the student likes.</p>
<p>This week, it&rsquo;s Westley&rsquo;s turn.</p>
<p>Yesterday we took in a photo of our family and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316144258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=quiddle-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316144258" target="_blank">a great book by Berkeley Breathed</a>.</p>
<p>Today he took in a snack of his choosing (goldfish and string cheese), his guitar and a CD of music that he liked.</p>
<p>When I told him that he could take in a favorite album, he couldn&rsquo;t come up with just one, so I suggested we put together a collection of some favorite songs. The assortment he came up with made my heart swell. He was so excited about every one of these songs:</p>

</ol><p>I&rsquo;m fairly certain that no other three year olds in his class are bringing in music from Zimbabwe in the early 1970s, let alone anything else on this list. Hopefully the rest of the class enjoys them as much as he does.</p>
<p>Oh, and the girls in his class flocked to him like moths to a flame when he put his guitar on. So, he&rsquo;s got that going for him.</p>
