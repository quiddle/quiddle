<p>Ever since our household became a dual iPhone home, I&rsquo;ve been looking for a shared list solution that syncs between phones. My wife and I create lists over time, and email or text each other when we think of something that we need- not a very elegant solution. There are a few applications built with this in mind, but they all overthink the problem. Some are so focused on groceries, that they&rsquo;re useless for other things; Others focus on price tracking and coupons. I don&rsquo;t care about databases of products and prices. I want a shopping list that I can edit on my phone and automatically shows up on my wife&rsquo;s.<!-- more --></p>
<p>I started using <a title="Hog Bay: PlainText's Developer" target="_blank" href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/plaintext">PlainText</a> to keep track of notes and ideas. It syncs with <a title="Dropbox.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, so all of these notes are automatically synced across all of my devices. Nice. The brainwave came when I considered what would happen when I accessed a Dropbox shared folder in PlainText. I created a <em>Lists </em>folder, shared it with my wife and gave her the same setup: a <em>Notes</em> folder in Dropbox that contains the shared <em>Lists</em> folder. Dropbox takes care of the syncing and basic merging <em>et voilà</em>, we have shared shopping lists!</p>
