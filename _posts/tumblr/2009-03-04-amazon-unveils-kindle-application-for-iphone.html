<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5izyWQSe2NDMadNq3YCn5o0bGMszAD96N0NQ80">Amazon unveils Kindle Application for iPhone</a><br/><p>Great. Now I can read ebooks on two devices that I don&rsquo;t own.</p>

This is a very nice move though. Amazon is trying hard to make it easy to &lsquo;own&rsquo; a DRM-locked ebook that syncs between devices.</p>
