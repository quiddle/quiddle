<a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/SuperModels/ItsSolarPowersTimeToShine.aspx?page=1">It's solar power's time to shine</a><br/><p>Not a very interesting article. It&rsquo;s talking about Solar Thermal Energy as an alternative energy source, which IS interesting, but what&rsquo;s changed?  I learned about STE when I was in fifth or sixth grade (around 1990).  STE was touted as the only real way to harvest solar energy.  Here we are twenty years later and it&rsquo;s still a great idea, but only an idea. What needs to happen to truly make these types of changeovers happen?</p>

<p>Global Warming, Carbon Footprints and everything else aside, isn&rsquo;t an energy source like this more attractive? No dependence on external sources&ndash;just start up and maintenance costs. I&rsquo;d think this would be ideal if I were an energy company.</p>
