<p>In this day and age, the purpose of being on a major label at all is for promotion and advertising. It costs little to make your music available, but promotion can still be time and money intensive. Rather than screwing over artists, I&rsquo;d think that labels should be reviewing their business models and reworking contracts.</p>
