It&rsquo;s a great song with difficult syncopation and rhythms. It&rsquo;s also a perfect illustration of how much the choir has grown over the past several years.<br/><br/> The drums and other percussion were not miked for this recording but they&rsquo;re still audible- let your imagination fill them in a little bit.</p>
