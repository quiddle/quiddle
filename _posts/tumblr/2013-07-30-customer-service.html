<p>Today I had lunch at the local Subway (<em>The</em> as in &ldquo;one of <em>the</em> four&rdquo;) and witnessed an interesting scenario.</p>

<p>The woman in front of me ordered a foot long turkey sub on white. As the <em>artiste</em> was creating his masterpiece, I could see this woman growing visibly distraught. Her shoulders slumped and her head started shaking back and forth, back and forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you take it from the bottom?&rdquo; she asked as the sandwich craftsman laid slice after slice of mechanically sliced turkey.</p>

<p>He looked up, surprised, still laying slices. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you take it from the bottom? Usually you take it from the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I just grabbed some,&rdquo; he replied, implacably laying yet another slice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;d feel better if you took it from the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all comes from the same package. It&rsquo;s all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point, another artisan came over. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know why he took it from the bottom. It seems like he should just grab it from the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really matter,&rdquo; the second  sub whiz replied, &ldquo;sometimes you just grab it from a different place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rather not have it from the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point, both of the creators looked at her blankly and then offered up yet another defense of the offending sandwich technique.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; said the woman and walked out with her head down. Both of the sandwich people gave me a &ldquo;God, how crazy was she&rdquo; look and then muttered to each other while they threw the sandwich masterpiece away.</p>

<p>Soâ€¦ what? Why bother relaying this story? I&rsquo;ve been in customer service positions before and I know there are customers you can&rsquo;t do anything about, but this woman? I&rsquo;m pretty sure she wasn&rsquo;t one of them. This was someone that a simple apology and an offer to start a new sandwich would probably have defused everything. But the employees were more concerned with defending their actions instead of pleasing a customer. There wasn&rsquo;t even the slightest bit of concern or empathy in their response to her. I don&rsquo;t feel like they did anything <em>wrong</em>, but I also don&rsquo;t feel like they did much right either.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
