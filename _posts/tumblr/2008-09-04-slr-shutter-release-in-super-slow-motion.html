<p>This also illustrates what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain to some people before- it&rsquo;s not so much the shutter that makes a lot of noise, but it&rsquo;s the mirror in the SLR flipping up that makes the clicky-clicky noise that everyone loves so much. That&rsquo;s why point and shoots don&rsquo;t make much noise at all!</p>
