title: 'One of the reasons kids get bored by science is that too many teachers present
  it as a fusty collection of facts for memorization. This is precisely wrong. Science
  isn’t about facts. It’s about the quest for facts – the scientific method, the process
  by which we hash through confusing thickets of ignorance. It’s dynamic, argumentative,
  collaborative, competitive, filled with flashes of crazy excitement and hours of
  drudgework, and driven by ego: Our desire to be the one who figures it out, at least
  for now. It’s dramatic and nutty and fun.'
