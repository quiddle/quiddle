<a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571">Treatment of Alan Turing was “appalling”</a><br/><p>Alan Turing is a figurehead in the computer science world. Apparently that didn&rsquo;t matter in 1952, when he was chemically castrated for being gay. Appalling indeed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a page of gay rights history that i was blissfully unaware of.</p>
