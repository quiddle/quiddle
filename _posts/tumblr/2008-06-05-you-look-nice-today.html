<a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">You Look Nice Today</a><br/><p>If you don&rsquo;t listen to <i>You Look Nice Today</i>, you&rsquo;re missing out. This is THE reason to start listening to podcasts.  Every episode has me laughing. It&rsquo;s completely inane, very smart and the delivery is completely straight. It&rsquo;s not news, it&rsquo;s not tech, it&rsquo;s simply whatever the team wants to chat about.</p>

<p>Each &lsquo;bit&rsquo; is separated by a mandolin interlude and introduced with an unrelated title by John Hodgman. Seriously. Listen. Dr. Mom, I&rsquo;m looking at you.</p>

<p>Episodes are available to listen on the website, but it&rsquo;s probably worth the two seconds to click on the iTunes link to subscribe to podcast (It&rsquo;s free!).</p>
