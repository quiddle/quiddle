<a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/blog/2008/06/12/the-cinematic-color-palette-pixar/">The Cinematic Color Palette: Pixar</a><br/><p>A fun review of Pixar and the colors that they use in their movies.  Best bit of trivia: the company that would become Pixar did work on <i>Young Sherlock Holmes</i>.</p>

<p>Of course I immediately went and added <i>Young Sherlock Holmes</i> to my Netflix queue.</p>
