title: Grown-ups don’t look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they’re
  big and thoughtless and they always know what they’re doing. Inside, they look just
  like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. Truth is, there aren’t
  any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.
