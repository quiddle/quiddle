title: Since businesses are obliged by zoning restrictions to locate far away from
  residential areas, most Americans drive to every store they visit. This means that
  store visits are often discrete trips that must be undertaken consciously and planned
  out ahead of time. As a consequence, shoppers will want to visit stores that carry
  the most diverse inventory—Wal-Mart, Costco, et al.—and avoid shops that specialize
  in one particular kind of good—the local paint store or flower shop, for instance.
