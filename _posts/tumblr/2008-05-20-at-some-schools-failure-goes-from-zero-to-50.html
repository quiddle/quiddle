<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-05-18-zeroes-main_N.htm">At some schools, failure goes from zero to 50</a><br/><p>First off, I find this depressing. As someone who occasionally <i>forgot</i> to turn in papers, I had all kinds of &lsquo;zeros&rsquo; to overcome, but could still manage to pass.  If I had turned in all my homework and then gotten an automatic fifty on tests, I would have passed just as easily.</p>

<p>I think the teachers probably should re-think their grading systems if this is really an issue.  And if kids are doing all of their work  and getting below fifty on everything, it sounds to me like there are other issues at hand.</p>

<p>Secondly, the rules about when to write numbers and when to write digits are pretty lax.  The only hard and fast rule is to be consistent.  The title of this article?  Yeah.  That&rsquo;s not a good example of that.</p>
