<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.improvementscatalog.com/home/improvements/25124-french-fry-holder.html" target="_blank"><strong>French Fry Holder</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cars now come with several cup holders, and this innovative accessory helps you make the most of them! French-Fry Holder holds one order of fries (and its cardboard container) close at hand! Even has a clip-on ketchup cup! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tip: You can also use the clip-on ketchup cup to hold whatâ€™s left of your human dignity. </p></blockquote>

<p>That ketchup holder doesn&rsquo;t look like it holds nearly enough ketchup for a certain wife of mine.</p>
