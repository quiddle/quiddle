<p>I&rsquo;ve had my iPod for almost four years now. I credit that purchase, along the creation of some great digital music stores (iTunes, <a href="http://www.emusic.com" target="_blank">emusic</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=163856011" target="_blank">Amazon MP3 Store</a>), with greatly expanding my taste in music and increasing the amount of music that I listen to. I&rsquo;m starting to think that a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle" target="_blank">Kindle</a> would do the same thing for my reading.</p>

<p>I love books. I have many of them, lining shelves and filling boxes. I love to re-read them and see my old dog-eared pages. I love the smell, new or old.</p>

<p>The problem with MY books, is that they&rsquo;re a crutch. My desire to read is usually sudden and the need must be quickly fulfilled. Invariably I wander to my bookshelf and pull something down that I&rsquo;ve already read. The public library is great, but it does little to satisfy a late night reading craving.</p>

<p>I like to read new authors and new books, but that&rsquo;s hard to do within the confines of your personal library. It&rsquo;s hard to pull down a book that your friend recommended when you don&rsquo;t own it!</p>

<p>The Kindle takes care of a lot of these problems. Someone recommends a books for you? You can download it wherever you are, so it&rsquo;s ready for the next urge. You can carry hundreds of titles at once without the load. It can even load up newspapers every morning.</p>

<p>What I hadn&rsquo;t realized until I watched the video demonstration on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle" target="_blank">the Kindle product page</a> is how <em>small</em> it is! It&rsquo;s much more portable than I realized. (By the way, go watch that video, it answers a lot of questions, albeit with some wooden acting)</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not buying one anytime soon&ndash;the cost is too high. Currently, the Kindle retails at $359&ndash;it needs to come down at least another $100. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of new models coming out&hellip; perhaps they&rsquo;ll debut with a lower price!</p>

<p>I wonder how they smell?</p>
