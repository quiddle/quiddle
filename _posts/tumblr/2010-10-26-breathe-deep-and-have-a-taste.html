<a href="http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/taste_receptors.htm">Breathe Deep and Have a Taste</a><br/><p>Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have discovered taste receptors in our lungs. They are exactly the same as those on our tongue, but only in the bitter variety.</p>
<p>The practical upshot of this is that when our lungs sense a bitter &ldquo;taste,&rdquo; they open the airways, making this discovery applicable for treating asthma and other similar conditions.</p>
<p>Neat.</p>
