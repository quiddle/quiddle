From about 2:00 in:
</p><blockquote>
<b>Reporter Anne Currie:</b> I know you said something very interesting. You said, &lsquo;If it had to happen it is good it happened at a Boy Scout Camp.&rsquo; Why would you, at the age of 13, say such a thing?
<br/><br/><b>Boy Scout Ethan Hession, 13:</b>
Because we were prepared. We knew that shock could happen. We knew that we needed to place tourniquets on wounds that were bleeding too much. We knew we needed to apply pressure and gauze. We had first-aid kits. We
had everything. We knew about this. We knew what to do. We had staff all around that had been trained for this. And if it had happened anywhere else, there wouldn&rsquo;t be that much that the people know.
</blockquote>

The poise of the two boys interviewed in this clip is amazing. I can hardly watch it without getting teary-eyed.
