<a href="http://ad.hominem.org/log/2005/07/acl.php">Share an iPhoto Library in Tiger Using ACL's.</a><br/><p>Access Control Lists (ACLs) are awesome. And they&rsquo;re what finally enable me to set up iPhoto so my wife and I can use the same photo library. Yay!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I ran into one snag following the directions I linked to. Fortunately the fix makes the whole process even easier.</p>

<p>When I used Symbolic Links (shortcuts) to trick iPhoto into opening the shared library (as suggested), everything would work until one of us would try to import. iPhoto would spit out an error about permissions. The fix? Don&rsquo;t use symbolic links! Open iPhoto while holding down Option. iPhoto asks which library you&rsquo;d like to open. Point it towards the shared library and everything works great!</p>
