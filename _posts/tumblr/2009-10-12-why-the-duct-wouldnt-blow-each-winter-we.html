<p>Each winter, we remember that the front bedrooms don&rsquo;t heat very well.<br/><br/>
I&rsquo;ve checked out the basement ductwork and plumbed the stack in the walls&ndash; all clear.<br/><br/>
Now that our third winter is coming up, I finally opened up the elbow that connects the basement ductwork to the wall stack.*<br/><br/>
This picture shows what I found in there.<br/><br/>
* This was no small feat- The wall stack is part of an old gravity heat system and is connected to a standard six inch duct with large box that sits up above the central beam in our basement. Once I finally pulled off the new ductwork, I had access to a hole that was 12&quot;x3&quot; and went back about 18 inches before the stack went up. Getting the frisbee out was particularly difficult. Oh, and did I mention the layers and layers of old paint over the screws and seams in the duct? Fun, fun!</p>
