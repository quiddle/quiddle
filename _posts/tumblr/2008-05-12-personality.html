<p>Ages ago, I took <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/" target="_blank">this Meyers-Briggs Personality Test for Programmers</a> and bookmarked the result. I was cleaning up bookmarks today and found <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/ENTPext.asp" target="_blank">this link to my personality profile (ENTP)</a>. Kind of eerie reading a description of myself written by someone that I&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
