<p>Dorothy has left me this weekend to go have fun in other parts of Ohio. She won&rsquo;t be up for trips for much longer- only two months and six days until we get to meet our newest family member!</p>

<p>My dad came over to help out today. How awesome. We got the master bedroom primed. On a whim, I purchased a masonry primer that&rsquo;s supposed to be good at filling in pits and cracks&ndash;our walls are plaster, they&rsquo;ve got plenty of those!  I asked the paint guru at Lowe&rsquo;s if he would tint the primer for me, even though it wasn&rsquo;t labeled as tintable.  He said he would, but no guarantees on color. &ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Our bedroom now looks like the inside of a Pepto Bismol bottle.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll still be easier to paint over than white.  I hope.</p>

<p>We also picked up the antique hutch that Dorothy and I are going to use as a changing table.  It didn&rsquo;t exactly fit into the car, so I drove home while he kept it from sliding out hatchback.</p>

<p>Then we replaced the garage door opener that blew out in a lightning storm&ndash;ten months ago!  I bought the same brand and type, which meant we were able to swap out the motor unit and not have to rehang the drive track. Once we got the coupler installed that connects the motor to the screw drive, it worked great!</p>

<p>So, a long day with a lot done. I owe so much to my Dad. Not just for a day of work, but for everything he&rsquo;s taught me.  I figure if I can be half as good as he&rsquo;s been, my kids should turn out alright.</p>
