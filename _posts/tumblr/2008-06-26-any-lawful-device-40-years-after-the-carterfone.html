<a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/carterfone-40-years.ars">Any lawful device: 40 years after the Carterfone decision</a><br/><p>It&rsquo;s always been my understanding that back in the day, AT&amp;T regulated the devices that could be used on their lines and today, just about anything with a plug can be used.</p>

<p>What was not clear to me, was how the precedent changed. This article discusses a landmark decision by the FCC to allow consumers to utilize any device on the AT&amp;T network.</p>

<p>Fascinating.</p>
