<blockquote><p>Great story about Grape Nuts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mixed with yeast (one cup per 2,000 pounds) and water, the flour turns to dough, gets chopped into 10-pound loaves and sent into a huge oven — 1,610 loaves at a time. “Now it gets interesting,” Mr. Vargas said at his workstation, watching the loaves emerge from the oven and catapult into the darkness. An instant later, they hit the fan — a whirling high-speed shredder that rips them to smithereens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <em>that’s</em> what they are: effectively, compacted croutons.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mmm&hellip; Croutons.</p>
