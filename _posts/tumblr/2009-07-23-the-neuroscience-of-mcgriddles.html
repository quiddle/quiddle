<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/07/the_neuroscience_of_mcgriddles.php">The Neuroscience of McGriddles</a><br/><blockquote>Let&rsquo;s imagine, for instance, that some genius invented a reduced calorie bacon product that tasted exactly like bacon, except it had 50 percent fewer calories. It would obviously be a great day for civilization. But this research suggests that such a pseudo-bacon product, even though it tasted identical to real bacon, would actually give us much less pleasure. </blockquote>
