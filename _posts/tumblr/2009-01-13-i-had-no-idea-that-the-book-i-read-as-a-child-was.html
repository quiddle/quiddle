(and based on the song too, of course.)</p>

<p>The sound is poor, but listenable. Here are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww3MIsefX7c" target="_blank">Part 2</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLj9Nj7sHM" target="_blank">Part 3</a> as well.</p>

<p>For some reason, I don&rsquo;t find the movie nearly as sad as the song by itself, although the single shot of Puff lying in his cave with his nose poking out did bring a tear to my eye.</p>
