<a href="http://waxy.org/2009/10/audio_analysis_of_the_beatles_multitrack_masters/">Audio Analysis of the Beatles Multitrack Masters</a><br/><p>A review of the recording and tracking process of three Beatles songs. &ldquo;Come Together&rdquo; fascinates me, because the isolated guitar track shows the essential humanity of George Harrison and how Lennon&rsquo;s scratch vocals show the evolution of the song.</p>

<p>Good stuff.</p>
