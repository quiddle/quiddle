<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95441421&ps=bb3">Farewell Opus; Hello Pete, The Perfectly Practical Pig : NPR</a><br/><p>For some reason, I just don&rsquo;t care. I liked &lsquo;Bloom County&rsquo; and then 'Outland&rsquo; lost a little of the magic, and 'Opus&rsquo; just never did it for me. I&rsquo;m guess I&rsquo;m happy that Berkeley Breathed is going to just leave Opus alone.</p>
