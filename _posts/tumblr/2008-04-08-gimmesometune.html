<a href="http://www.eternalstorms.at/gimmesometune/">GimmeSomeTune</a><br/><p>Trying this out right now.  It may displace <a href="http://www.yellowmug.com/sk4it/" title="Yellow Mug Software - Sizzling Keys Page" target="_blank">Sizzling Keys</a> as my iTunes controller.  Of course I had to reset all of the hotkeys to match my reflexes.</p>

<p>First impression is that it&rsquo;s built by a programmer, not a designer.  That&rsquo;s ok for me.  I like the built in lyrics fetcher too!  If the Last.fm feature synced up a playlist  like iScrobbler, it&rsquo;d replace two apps in one!</p>
