  For Dr. Mom, who was never a sisty ugler.

  For those of you without a clue as to what this is, it’s Jack Ross, doing his rendition of Cinderella. It was a hit around 1962. On the other side of the 45 was his song called Margarita. My sister and I used to listen to Cinderella on her little red  record player and laugh ourselves silly. Apparently, it’s still funny in digital format.
