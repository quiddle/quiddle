Exploding Dog is awesome. Readers send Sam short phrases and he makes a drawing to go with it. Sometimes they&rsquo;re funny, sometimes sad, sometimes clever or just confusing. When you view any of the drawings, you can click it to go to the previous drawing in the archive. (in other words, it&rsquo;s a time waster!)</p>
